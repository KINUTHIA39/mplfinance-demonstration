## This project just shows a small snippet of how to use the mplfinance library. I used it to analyse AAPL stock prices for some few days, 120 days. There's some code you can use to come up with cusome charts. 
## Exmaples of charts one can come up with are; 
###                                             1. candle stick charts
###                                             2. line charts
###                                             3. renko charts
###                                             4. point and figure charts, etc
